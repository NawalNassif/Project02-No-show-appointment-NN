# Project02-No-show-appointment-NN
  Investigate a dataset "No-show appointments" using the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

This project was submitted as part of the data analyst nanodegree certification process. 
In this project, I investigate the no-show appointment dataset available on Kaggle. 
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and focuses on whether or not patients attend their appointments.
Many patient characteristics are included, such as 
scheduledday (the day the patients schedule their appointments), gender, age, 
neighborhood (the location of the hospital), 
and scholarship (indicates whether the patient is enrolled in Brazilian welfare. The Bolsa Familia provides financial assistance to low-income Brazilian families.), 
patient medical conditions (such as hypertension, diabetes...), 
and finally whether or not patients received an SMS and whether or not they attended their appointments (noting that the data shows the no-show up value as "Yes").

The main questions I investigate to determine what factors predict patients' attendance at scheduled appointments are:
Q1: Do patients who receive SMS attend their appointments more frequently than those who do not?
Q2: Do patients who are enrolled in a scholarship with Bolsa Familia show up for their scheduled appointments more than other patients?
Q3: Do patients with specific medical conditions or a specific lifestyle show up for their appointments more than other patients? and what about many medical conditions?
Q4: Is the duration between the scheduled and appointment dates associated with the attendance of patients at their appointments?
